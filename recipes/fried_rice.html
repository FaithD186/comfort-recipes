    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This take-out classic is an easy weeknight meal! It's made on the stovetop with chicken, eggs, onions, carrots, peas, and rice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>Peas</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice your chicken into small cubes and salt it, whisk the egg, make sure all the veggies are diced and ready to go.</li>
        <li>Scramble the egg, then remove it from the pan. You want to cook the egg first so that it doesn't end up overcooking and so that the egg stays in larger pieces.</li>
        <li>Stir fry the chicken, then it remove it from the pan, too. Make sure it's cooked all the way through.</li>
        <li>Cook the vegetables, but leave them IN the pan!</li>
        <li>Add the rice, season it, then add the egg and chicken back to the pan.</li>
    </ol>

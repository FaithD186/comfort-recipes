        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shakshuka is an easy, healthy breakfast (or any time of day) recipe in Israel and other parts of the 
                    Middle East and North Africa. It's a simple combination of simmering tomatoes, onions, garlic, spices 
                    and gently poached eggs.</p>
        <p>The seasoning can vary from one recipe to another, but you'll often find warm spices like cumin, paprika, and crushed 
                    red pepper flakes for some heat.</p>
